This extension, when activated, allows the user to toggle image pixelation on and off.

As an example, I often use the Javascript-based Texas Instruments 99/4A emulator:

On my screen, the emulation image appears to be undergoing antialiasing, and looks
fuzzy and blurry.

To get a pixel perfect image, you need to turn on Chrome's "pixelation" mode.

To use the extension, click on the blue (C) copyright symbol on the top-right of Chrome.
